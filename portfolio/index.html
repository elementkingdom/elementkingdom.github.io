Hi there!

I know its exciting to look into the inner workings of someone's code. But alas, 
examining my code here won't reveal much as this was quickly thrown together. However 
you can inspect the projects I have linked to the the HTML doc. Some of these projects 
are old. Much of my newer stuff I don't feel comfortable leaving open to the public as
it is proprietary software.

I am also showing you a lot of end results and not showing off a lot of my thought 
processes and problem solving, which I think is very important. I hope to talk to you 
soon and I can reveal a little more.

Also, if you haven't already please check out my dribbble account

Regards,
Michael
